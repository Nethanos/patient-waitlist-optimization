# patient-waitlist-optimizer

## Overview

This library provides a scoring algorithm to sort a patient waitlist. It calculates a score for each patient based on age, distance, and behavioral data.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add patient-waitlist-optimizer
```

## Usage

Import the main function from the package root:

```js
import { computeScore } from 'patient-waitlist-optimizer';

const patient = {
  age: 45,
  location: { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 },
  acceptedOffers: 10,
  canceledOffers: 2,
  averageReplyTime: 1200
};
const targetLocation = { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 };

const score = computeScore(patient, targetLocation);
// score is a number between 1 and 10
```

## API
